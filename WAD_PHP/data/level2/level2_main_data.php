So why would you want to use the upper/lower workout routine? Here are the 4 advantages.<br><br>

#1 It Simplifies Your Training:<br><br>

Some workout programs can get very complicated. Especially if you are doing several exercises, and mixing and matching upper and lower body exercises per day.<br><br>

With the upper/lower split, each workout is specifically tailored to just a few key muscle groups.<br><br>

In general, you will train 3-4 upper body exercises on one day, and 3-4 lower body exercises on another.<br><br>

That’s it.<br><br>

I’ll go into more detail later.<br><br>

#2 It Maximizes Recovery:<br><br>

By training your upper body on one day, then your lower body on another, you allow for a decent amount of recovery between sessions.<br><br>

For example:<br><br>

On a 4 day/week workout program – you will take one day off after training the upper body and the lower body. This will then give you a full 72 hours before you train the upper body again.<br><br>

In general, you want at least 48 hours of rest before training the exact same muscle group.<br><br>

#3 It Minimizes Exercise Overlap:<br><br>

Some workout programs inadvertently train the same muscle groups too frequently.<br><br>

For example:<br><br>

Let’s say you bench press on Monday, and shoulder press on Tuesday.<br><br>

The bench press uses a good deal of shoulder strength.<br><br>

As a result, your shoulders may not be fully recovered to perform at their best on Tuesday.<br><br>

This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the upper/lower split eliminates this issue.<br><br>

#4 Easy to organize:<br><br>

Lastly, it’s easy to write an upper/lower workout program.<br><br>

As long as you select the right exercises, it’s difficult to mess up your workouts.<br><br>

In fact, you can get away with doing just two unique workouts, twice a week.<br><br>
