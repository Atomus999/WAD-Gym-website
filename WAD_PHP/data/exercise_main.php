  <p>If you are motivated, let's talk about process of training we provide.<br><br>

      First of all, the purpose of this website is suggesting way to do exercise at home,<br>
     we consider people who take exercise at home as beginner. <br>
     Therefore, almost all of our contents will consist of basic trainings.<br>
     The exercise without equipment is called Calisthenics.<br>
   </p>

   <p>In the beginner level, you will learn stretching and full body training.<br>
     As a beginner, it's likely to best to start with a "full body workout routine 3 days per week" in order to master the main movements without causing excessive muscle damage.
   </p>

   <p>In the intermediate level, you will split workout in 2parts, upper and lower.<br>
     This is the most popular way to train, and normally made of 4 days per week routine.<br>
   </p>

     <p>In the advanced level, you may think that you are not able to see the effects of Calisthenics anymore.<br>
       We recommend you to buy some exercise equipment for this level.<br>
       Dumbells between 20kg ~ 30kg are the perfect weights to do what we will introduce<br>
     </p>
