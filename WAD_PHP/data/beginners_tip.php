<h2 class="beginnertitle">Make a Plan and Set Realistic Goals:</h2>
<p>
  Once you decide to start exercising regularly, try to create a plan that includes attainable steps and goals.
  One way to do this is to start with a plan of easy steps to follow. Then you can continue building on it as your fitness level improves.
</p>

<p>
For example, if your goal is to finish a five-kilometer run, you can start by building a plan that includes shorter runs.
Once you are able to finish those short runs, increase the distance until you can run the whole five kilometers continuously.
</p>

<p>
Starting with small goals will not only increase your chances of success, it will also keep you motivated every step of the way.

<h2 class="beginnertitle">Important starting tips:</h2>

<div class="content">
<h3>1.Stay hydrated</h3>
<p>Drinking enough fluids every day is essential for maintaining healthy hydration levels</p>
<p>Replenishing fluids during exercise is important for maintaining optimal performance, especially when exercising in hot temperatures</p>

<h3>2.Eat well</h3>
<p>All food groups are necessary to sustain healthy energy levels and get the most out of your workout. Carbs are particularly important, as they can fuel your muscles before exercise</p>

<p>Carbs are also important after exercise to replenish glycogen stores and assist the absorption of amino acids into your muscles during recovery</p>

<p>Additionally, protein improves muscle recovery after exercise, repairs tissue damage and builds muscle mass</p>
<h3>3.Warm up</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s important to warm up before your workout. Doing so can help prevent injuries and improve your athletic performance </p>

<p>Simply start your workout with some aerobic exercises like arm swings, leg kicks and walking lunges</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can warm up by doing easy movements of the exercise you are planning to do. For example, walk before you run</p>
<h3>4.Take breaks</h3>
<p>Cooling down is also important because it helps your body return to its normal state </p>

<p>Examples of cooling down include taking a short break after an intense exercise, but also for example light walking after aerobic exercise or stretching after resistance training</p>
<h3>5.Rest</h3>
<p>If you feel pain or discomfort while exercising, stop and rest before continuing. Pushing through the pain is not a good idea, as it can cause injuries. </p>

<p>Also, remember that working out harder and faster is not necessarily better.Taking your time to progress through your fitness program can help you maintain your routine in the long term and make the most of it</p>
