  <p>Welcome to the full body work out!<br><br>

</div>



<div class="contents_2">

  We have two videos of full body work out, one for men, one for women.<br>
  The videos are all for 20minutes, but it does not matter how long will it take since you are beginner.<br>
  It is more important that you are able to finish this routine!<br>
  We recommend you to watch explanation videos first and then start working out to prevent injury<br>
